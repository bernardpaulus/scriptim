Commands within scriptim
-------------------------

There are two kinds of commands:

 * normal commands : commands that will be sent to the card reader
 * scriptim control commands: commands used to change the current card reader, exit, ...

Commands can include "#" comments and backslash-continuation of commands

Normal commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Canonical normal commands are composed of bytes in hexadecimal notation. That is
groups of 2 hexadecimal characters.

    Example::

        FF 00 48 00 00 , FF 00 40 50 04 05 05 03 01

Scriptim, however, admits some shortcuts:

 * you may write groups that begin by '0' only by writing their low-order hex
   Example::

       FF 0 48 0 0
       FF 0 40 50 4 5 5 3 1

 * you may collate any number of groups together, on the condition that they are
   not shortcuts of a high-order '0', like above
   Example::

       FF00 480000
       FF0040500405050301

scriptim control commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

scriptim currently admits 2 types of commands:

 * exit commands: exit, quit, EOF (<CTRL+D>)
   those commands cause scriptim to exit immediately, regardless of being part
   of a backslash-continued command

 * connection commands: reset, changereader
   both cause the connection to be renewed. changereader allows the selection
   of a different reader, or even no reader

comments, and backslash-continued commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comments are marked by '#'. That mark, and everything that follows will be
ignored

Backslash-continued commands. If a backslash '\' is the last character on that
line, excluding comments, the next command is the continuation of the current
command, last backslash removed.

Example::

    FF 00 48\# beginning of the command
    00 00    # end of the command

is equivalent to::

    FF 00 48 00 00


Known problems
===============

On debian, sometimes pcsc will cause syslog to print a small message.
tail /var/log/syslog

shows messages like:

pcscd: pcscdaemon.c:663:clean_temp_files() Cannot remove ...

This is due to a bug of pcsc_lite that has been fixed in the svn, but not yet
packaged.
