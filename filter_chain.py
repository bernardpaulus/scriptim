# Design of the filter chain
# see original issue: https://github.com/bernardpaulus/scriptim/issues/8
#
# To recall, a filter chain is organised in zones. Each of those zones is
# delimited by a terminal filter. That filter transforms the data in another
# format. In other words, data in a zone possess some common characteristics
#
# A filter has two possibilities : execute an action (exit, send APDU, ...) or
# transform the input, passing it to the next module

If this filter decides to execute some action (exit, sendAPDU, ...), it must
return.

On the contrary, if the data needs more treatment, it will call
self.exec_next() to propagate the data through the chain.

If everything goes correctly, the modules that decides to execute an action will
return something. This something will be propagated back through the chain, and
possibly modified.

If this filter encounter an error while processing the data, it will raise a
Processing_Exception.

There is two kinds of processing errors: 
- the ones where the error can be pinpointed, for example when a user makes an
  error in his input,
- and the ones where we can't, like when we are unable to send a command because
  the reader is disconnected

When a module can pinpoint the origin of an error it must use an instance of
Pinpointed_Error. 

The problem with this type of errors is that some filters might modify the
structure of the data. For the ones that do, it's their responsibility to trace
back the origin of the error in the data they initially received.
